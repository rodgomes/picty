# Picty

Just an exercise with Elixir/Phoenix where I'm going to create a website to search a picture service like Flickr, and show pictures of a given city in a given month.  

So, if you are planning to visit a city / town in the middle of the winter, you could possibly have an idea on how it's there based on the pictures.
